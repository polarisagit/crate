::

    ALTER CLUSTER
      { REROUTE RETRY FAILED }


Description
===========

``ALTER CLUSTER`` applies a change to the cluster state.

Arguments
=========

``REROUTE RETRY FAILED``
------------------------

The index setting ``index.allocation.max_retries`` indicates the
maximum of attempts to allocate a shard on a node. If this limit is reached it
leaves the shard unallocated.
This command allows the enforcement to retry the allocation of any unallocated
shard in the cluster. See :ref:`ddl_reroute_shards` to get convenient use-cases.

The rowcount defines if the allocation process of all unassigned shards in the
cluster was acknowledged or rejected.
